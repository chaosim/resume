		<p><span class="bodytext">Yônké's résumé is a licensee of the TRUSTe 
		Privacy Program. TRUSTe is an independent, non-profit organization whose 
		mission is to enable individuals and organizations to establish trusting 
		relationships based on respect for personal identity and information by 
		promoting the use of fair information practices. </span></p>
		<p><span class="bodytext">Yônké's résumé adheres to the European Union

		Commerce regarding the collection, use, and retention of personal

		All “personal information” (&quot;personal information&quot; is defined as any 
		information that identifies or can be used to identify, contact or 
		locate the person to whom such information pertains) that we collect and 
		maintain will be subject to the version of the Privacy Policy in effect 
		at the time of such collection. Yônké's résumé reserves the right to 
		change the Privacy Policy from time to time at its sole discretion, and 
		will provide notice of material changes on the homepage of the Site. If 
		as the result of such changes, you want to alter the ways in which 
		Yônké's résumé is allowed to use your personal information, you can do 
		so by following the procedure described below in the section entitled 
		“Updating your Personal Information and Privacy Preferences. You will be 
		deemed to have been made aware of, and will be subject to, the changes 
		to the Privacy Policy by your continued use of the Site after such 
		notice has been posted for thirty (30) days with the following 
		exception:&nbsp; if at the time you provide personal information to Yônké's 
		résumé you are given the opportunity (as you currently are) to limit how 
		such information will be used to communicate with you, either by Yônké's 
		résumé or by third parties, Yônké's résumé will not change your 
		preference in this regard without your express consent. However, if 
		Yônké's résumé sells assets (or the assets of a division or subsidiary) 
		to another entity, or Yônké's résumé (or a division or subsidiary) is 
		acquired by or merged with, another entity, Yônké's résumé may provide 
		to such entity customer information that is related to that part of our 
		business that was sold to or merged with the other entity without your 
		consent. </span></p>
		<p><span class="bodytext"><b>Entities Collecting Personal Information</b><br>
		Personal information on this Site is collected by Yônké's résumé Systems 
		Incorporated. Yônké's résumé’s address is 345 Park Avenue, San Jose, CA 
		95110 and its telephone number is (408) 536-6000. </span></p>
		<p><span class="bodytext">The Site contains links to other sites at 
		which personal information is collected. In such instances, unless 
		expressly provided to the contrary, the collection and use of your 
		personal information will be governed by the privacy policy applicable 
		to that site. That privacy policy should identify the entity that is 
		collecting your personal information. </span></p>
		<p><span class="bodytext"><b>Collection of Personal Information</b><br>
		As a visitor to this Site, you can engage in many activities without 
		providing any personal information. In connection with other activities, 
		such as utilizing online software applications, Yônké's résumé may ask 
		you to provide certain information about yourself by filling out and 
		submitting an online form. It is completely optional for you to engage 
		in these activities. If you elect to engage in these activities, 
		however, Yônké's résumé may ask that you provide us personal 
		information, such as your first and last name, mailing address 
		(including zip code), e-mail address, employer, job title and 
		department, telephone and facsimile numbers, and other personal 
		information. When ordering products or services on the Site, you may be 
		asked to provide a credit card number. Depending upon the activity, some 
		of the information that we ask you to provide is identified as mandatory 
		and some as voluntary. If you do not provide the mandatory data with 
		respect to a particular activity, you will not be able to engage in that 
		activity. </span></p>
		<p><span class="bodytext">When you use the Site, Yônké's résumé or third 
		parties authorized by Yônké's résumé may also collect certain technical 
		and routing information about your computer to facilitate your use of 
		the Site and its services. For example, we may log environmental 
		variables, such as browser type, operating system, CPU speed, and the 
		Internet Protocol (&quot;IP&quot;) address of your computer. We use these 
		environmental variables to facilitate and track your use of the Site and 
		its services. Yônké's résumé also uses such environmental variables to 
		measure traffic patterns on the Site. Without expressly informing you in 
		each particular circumstance, we do not match such information with any 
		of your personal information. </span></p>
		<p><span class="bodytext">When you submit personal information to 
		Yônké's résumé through this Site, you understand and agree that this 
		information may be transferred across national boundaries and may be 
		stored and processed in any of the countries in which Yônké's résumé and 
		its affiliates and subsidiaries maintain offices, including without 
		limitation, the United States. You also acknowledge that in certain 
		countries or with respect to certain activities, the collection, 
		transferring, storage and processing of your information may be 
		undertaken by trusted vendors of Yônké's résumé. Such vendors are bound 
		by contract to not use your personal information for their own purposes 
		or provide it to any third parties. One instance where this could occur 
		is in conjunction with framed pages in which the url for the pages is 
		not visible and the pages are being hosted by a vendor of Yônké's 
		résumé. </span></p>
		<p><span class="bodytext">Yônké's résumé has established relationships 
		with various service providers whose services are available to you from 
		this Site or from web sites that are linked to this Site. Typically, 
		these providers offer services that Yônké's résumé customers might find 
		useful, such as those that can be used in conjunction with Yônké's 
		résumé services and products. In order to use those services, you may be 
		required to provide personal information to the providers. Unless 
		expressly provided to the contrary, personal information that you 
		provide while you are visiting a provider’s web site will be subject to 
		the privacy policy posted on such site and personal information that you 
		provide while on this Site in conjunction with a provider’s service will 
		be subject to this Privacy Policy. You should be aware that our 
		agreements with these service providers often provide that they will 
		share with Yônké's résumé personal information collected from you. In 
		such instances, Yônké's résumé may use this information in a manner 
		consistent with this Privacy Policy. In the situation where sites have 
		an Yônké's résumé “look and feel,” and you reasonably believe you are on 
		an Yônké's résumé site, the site is collecting information in a solely 
		intermediary capacity and does not use personal information for 
		secondary purposes. </span></p>
		<p><span class="bodytext"><font color="black">In order to reduce errors 
		in our database, authenticate our users and prevent abuse of our system 
		we may on occasion supplement the personal information you submit to us 
		with information from third party sources. For example, we may 
		supplement your registration information with address information 
		provided by the U.S. Postal Service to qualify your information and 
		prevent errors in our database. </font></span></p>
		<p><span class="bodytext"><b>How your Personal Information is Used</b><br>
		Yônké's résumé collects your information in order to record and support 
		your participation in the activities you select. If you subscribe to a 
		service or register a product, for example, the information is used to 
		register your rights, if any, to technical support or other benefits 
		that may be made available to registered users. As another example, if 
		you enter a contest, information is collected to qualify the entry and 
		contact you regarding the contest or prize awards. Your personal 
		information is also used to keep you informed about product upgrades, 
		special offers, and other products and services of Yônké's résumé and 
		selected third parties if you have so opted to receive such 
		communications. </span></p>
		<p><span class="bodytext">Yônké's résumé may collect information about 
		the use of the Site; such as the types of services used and how many 
		users we receive daily. This information is collected in aggregate form, 
		without identifying any user individually. Yônké's résumé may use this 
		aggregate, non-identifying statistical data for statistical analysis, 
		marketing or similar promotional purposes. </span></p>
		<p><span class="bodytext"><b>Your Choices with Respect to Personal 
		Information</b><br>

		use of information collected on this Site. Without your consent, Yônké's 
		résumé will not communicate any information to you regarding products, 
		services and special offers available from Yônké's résumé, although we 
		may find it necessary to communicate with you regarding your use of the 
		services on this Site. Except in the particular circumstances described 
		in this Privacy Policy, Yônké's résumé will also not provide your name 
		to other companies or organizations without your consent. </span></p>
		<p><span class="bodytext">There are other instances in which Yônké's 
		résumé may divulge your personal information. Yônké's résumé may provide 
		your personal information if necessary, in Yônké's résumé’s good faith 
		judgement, to comply with laws or regulations of a governmental or

		Registration Information is protected in several ways. Access by you to 
		your Registration Information is available through a password and unique 
		customer ID selected by you. This password is encrypted.&nbsp; We recommend 
		that you do not divulge your password to anyone. In addition, your 
		Registration Information resides on a secure server that only selected 
		Yônké's résumé personnel and contractors have access to via password. 
		Yônké's résumé encrypts your personal information and thereby strives to 
		prevent unauthorized parties from viewing such information when it is 
		transmitted to Yônké's résumé.</span></p>
		<p><span class="bodytext">Personal information that you provide that 
		does not constitute Registration Information also resides on a secure 
		server and is only accessible to selected Yônké's résumé personnel and 
		contractors via password. Since this information is not accessible by 
		you, you will not be asked to select a password in order to view or 
		modify such information. </span></p>
		<p><span class="bodytext">Please note that any information you post to a 
		public bulletin board or chat room, such as the Yônké's résumé User to 
		User Forums (the “Forums”), is available to all persons accessing that 
		location. Your email address will not automatically be posted on the 
		Forums unless you modify the default setting to permit that. Your email 
		address would then be available to all persons accessing the Forums. In 
		addition, you should be aware that the Forums offers a service in which 
		subscribers are emailed a copy of all messages posted to the Forums on a 
		particular topic. Consequently, if you post a message to the Forums your 
		email address will be sent to those subscribers that have indicated an 
		interest in the topic of your message. </span></p>
